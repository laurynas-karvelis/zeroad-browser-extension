# Discover a Cleaner, Faster, and Fair Web

Sick of ads, cookie popups, and paywalls? The Zero Ad Network extension removes the clutter while making sure the sites you love actually get paid.

## What It Does

REMOVES THE ANNOYING STUFF
• Ads and tracking scripts disappear on partner sites
• No more cookie consent banners
• Marketing popups? Gone.

UNLOCKS PREMIUM CONTENT
• Read articles behind paywalls
• Access basic subscription features
• One subscription, multiple sites

PAYS CREATORS FAIRLY
• Sites you visit get paid based on your time spent
• No more choosing between ad blockers and supporting creators
• Your subscription fee goes directly to the content you consume

## How It Works

1. PICK YOUR PLAN
   Clean Web: Ad-free browsing, zero trackers
   One Pass: Access paywalled content across partner sites
   Freedom: Everything included

2. INSTALL AND FORGET
   Available for Chrome, Firefox, and Edge. Installs in seconds.

3. BROWSE NORMALLY
   The extension handles everything automatically. Visit partner sites and enjoy a cleaner experience.

## Why This Beats Regular Ad Blockers

Ad blockers hurt creators. We don't.

Traditional ad blockers cut off website revenue entirely. Zero Ad Network replaces that revenue fairly:
• Sites get paid when you visit them
• You get an ad-free experience
• Everybody wins

PLUS:
• Privacy-first (we don't sell your data)
• One subscription instead of dozens
• No configuration needed
• Works on thousands of partner sites

## How Sites Get Paid

When you visit a partner site:

1. Extension sends a secure token proving you're a subscriber
2. Site enables your benefits (removes ads, unlocks content)
3. Anonymous metrics tracked (time spent, pages viewed)
4. Monthly payout based on your actual usage

The more you visit a site, the more they earn. Simple.

## The Big Picture

The web shouldn't force you to choose between privacy and supporting creators.

Right now, websites either:
• Spam you with ads and tracking
• Lock everything behind paywalls
• Sell your data to survive

Zero Ad Network offers a third option: direct support through a single subscription.

No ads. No tracking. No juggling 20 different paywalls. Just a better web that works for everyone.

## Privacy Guarantee

WHAT WE SEND:
• A subscription token to all sites you visit (so partner sites can recognize you)
• Anonymous usage stats only for partner sites

WHAT WE DON'T DO:
• Sell your data
• Include personal info in tokens
• Track you on non-partner sites
• Share your browsing history

The token just says "this person is a subscriber" - nothing about who you are.

## Get Started

Change plans or cancel anytime. No long-term commitment. No hassle.
