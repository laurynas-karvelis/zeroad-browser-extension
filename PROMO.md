# Discover a Cleaner, Faster, and Fair Web

Tired of ads, pop-ups, cookie consent banners, and endless paywalls? With the Zero Ad Network browser extension, you can enjoy the web the way it was meant to be—clean, uninterrupted, and user-friendly—while supporting the creators behind the content you love.

## What the Extension Does

The Zero Ad Network browser extension works quietly in the background to:

- Remove Ads and Trackers: Say goodbye to intrusive advertisements, annoying pop-ups, and unnecessary tracking scripts on partnered sites.
- Bypass Paywalls: Access subscription-only content and basic plans on partner sites without paying multiple times.
- Support Creators Fairly: A portion of your subscription fee is automatically sent to the sites you actually visit, rewarding them based on your engagement.
- Think of it as a smarter, safer alternative to traditional ad blockers: one subscription gives you access to multiple sites, while creators get fairly compensated for their work.

## How It Works

1. Enjoy a Better Web

Choose the plan that fits your browsing needs:

- Clean Web – Ad-free browsing, no trackers, and no pop-ups.
- One Pass – Access paywalled content and basic subscriptions on partner sites.
- Freedom – Combines both Clean Web and One Pass for the ultimate experience.

The lightweight browser extension is available for Chrome and Firefox. Once installed, it automatically applies your subscription features whenever you visit a partner site.

Browse without clutter, pop-ups, or interruptions. At the same time, the sites you visit are rewarded fairly for the content they provide.

## Why It’s Different From Ad Blockers

- Privacy First: Your personal data is never sold or shared.
- Fair Compensation: Instead of harming sites’ revenue like traditional ad blockers do, your subscription directly rewards the sites you visit.
- One Payment, Multiple Benefits: Access multiple sites’ content without juggling dozens of subscriptions.
- Seamless Experience: No technical setup, no manual tweaks, no extra configuration needed.

## How Your Subscription Supports Websites

When you visit a partner site:

- The browser extension sends a secure token confirming your active subscription.
- The partner site uses this token to apply the features you’re entitled to—removing ads, bypassing paywalls, and unlocking basic subscriptions.
- Your time spent and page views are anonymously tracked (only for partner sites) to ensure fair revenue distribution.
- At the end of each month, your subscription fee is proportionally shared among the sites you visited.

This encourages websites to provide higher-quality, ad-free content and paywall-free access for subscribers.

## Benefits at a Glance

- Ad-Free Browsing: Enjoy a smooth, distraction-free experience.
- Paywall Access: Read articles, stream content, or use services without additional subscriptions.
- Privacy & Security: Minimal data collection, no personal info sold or shared.
- Support Creators: Your subscription helps fund the websites you actually use.
- Simple & Flexible: Install, sign in, and browse. Change or cancel plans anytime.

## The Vision

We believe the internet should work like a utility: clean, fair, and accessible. Instead of relying on ads and data tracking, Zero Ad Network ensures creators are compensated directly for the value they provide, while users enjoy a smooth, uninterrupted web experience.

By subscribing and installing the extension, you help create a web that works for everyone—users, creators, and publishers alike.
